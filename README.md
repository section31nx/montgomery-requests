# 🔑 MontgomeryNX Proxy Requests Wrapper

A drop-in replacement for Python's `requests` that routes all calls through the [MontgomeryNX](https://www.montgomerynx.com) scraping proxy.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install montgomery_requests
```

## 🚀 Usage
In place of import requests, 

```python
import montgomery_requests as mrequests

mrequests.set_api_key("your_api_key")

response = mrequests.get("https://example.com")
print(response.text)
```

Behind the scenes, the URL is rewritten to:

`https://proxy.montgomerynx.com/<your_api_key>/https://example.com`


## 🔐 API Key

Call once `set_api_key("your_api_key")` before making requests. 


## ✨ Features

- One-liner replacement for `requests`
- IP rotation, retries, and caching handled automatically
- Works with all HTTP methods: `get`, `post`, `put`, `delete`, `head`, `options`
- No extra dependencies beyond `requests`
- Perfect for scraping-friendly public sites
